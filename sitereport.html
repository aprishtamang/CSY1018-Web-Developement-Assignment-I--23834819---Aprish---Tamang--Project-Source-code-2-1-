                    <h2> My Website Development Experiences</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am grateful to NAMI college and my module tutor,<br>
                         Chirag Thapa, for providing me with the opportunity to enhance my web development skills.<br>
                          I had my first experience with coding and web development in 2018 when I learned Graphics designing, HTML, CSS.<br>
                           Initially, I faced some difficulties, but with time, I learned a lot and became more confident in coding.<br>
                        In 2018, during my +2 studies, I had a lesson on web designing, and I created a website for my dad business.<br>
                         Then in 2020, during my 12th grade, I learned C language, c++, which was new to me, and I found it more complicated than HTML and CSS,<br>
                          but still, I quickly grasped it because of my coding knowledge in different p-languages. I even scored good marks during my examination.<br>
                           However, due to the COVID 19 pandemic, I had to take a break. After the pandemic was controlled,I applied to USA for my further studies but the interviewer did not give
                        me the visa. I was so confused during that time what to do and what not to,and one of my friend suggested me<br>
                        to join NAMI college then, I joined NAMI college to pursue a bachelor's degree. The environment of the college is peaceful and fulfilling,<br>
                         just as my friend mentioned. The Web Development module (CSY1018) taught me HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub, <br>
                         which were all new to me. Though Git and GitHub seemed daunting at first, they turned out to be easy and fun<br>
                          to use after some time.
                        I found that display: Grid was a new feature that I had never used before,<br>
                         and it was more complex than float and flex, but it was more convenient and faster.<br>
                          My favorite colors are Blue,white, yellow and green and I choose them for main work in my webpages.
                        I often browsed Pinterest and Google for designing my webpage. I visited my sites through which<br>
                         i can get few knowledge about designing and viewed various templates online.
                        <br>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Home page explanation</h3>
                    <p>In this page, I have used various types of colors to make my web homepage more attractive <br>
                        and give a different vibrant looks for my initial page. I used a loading animation as one<br>
                         of my decorative part of my site using multiple colored border. Talking about the navigation<br>
                          I have included 4 different divisions, which are:- language selection part, menu-items,<br>
                           logo of my own picture and hamburger which is hidden in desktop view and only visible<br>
                            after certain width and height is set i.e,1000px.</p>
                    <h3>Contact page explanation</h3>
                    <p>In contact page, I provided a form which should(Not mandatory)<br>
                         be filled by the  visitors of my website. Along with it I have<br>
                          given the contact information. If anyone want to know<br>
                           about this website more feel free to contact me. For further more information<br>
                            or you have any queries then you can directly click on the mail/contact inside<br>
                             the mobile icon which will be displayed on my page.</p>
                    <h3>Portfolio page explanation</h3>
                    <p>This is a page to display my small academic details and my photo gallery. Here, I have used grid in the gallery <br>
                        section mentioning row gap and column gap for each. I think this will be<br>
                         the best example for the next coder whoever will be visiting my site for the sample. </p>
                    <h3>workexperience page explanation</h3>
                    <p>This is the section on my website, which is a brief about me and what I have done in my past and the experiences,<br>

                          Here, It is a simple type of work experience format. </p>
                    <h3>Site Report page explanation</h3>
                    <p>This is section which is my overall outcome of my website.<br>
